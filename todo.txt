1) Implement Forking - DONE
2) Implement Selfish Mining
3) Implement Banning

Experiments:
* Show that the experiments satisfy the basic assumption that honest pools receive a reward proportional to their
    computing power
* Show how selfish mining allows pools to earn more than their computing power.
* Show how, for a selfish pool, the bigger it is the more it earns.
    This shows that pool size ~ propagation factor (gamma)
* Show how pools are more robust to selfish mining, due to them being more connected
* Something about pool connectivity
* Show when a banning attack is effect
    for instance,

Graphs:
* Relative Reward by Pool Power (RR/PP), 3 lines:
    1. Linear y=x, expected reward of honest miners
    2. Scatter of the rewards of an honest pools, each point is averaged over 10 trials
    3. Scatter of the rewards of a selfish pools, each point is averaged over 10 trials

* RR/PP, with 5 lines, all selfish pools:
    1. Pool with baseline size and connectivity
    2/3. Pool with low/high size and average connectivity
    4/5. Pool with average size and low/high

* RR/PP with 4 lines:
    1/2. Reward of selfish pool with high size and connectivity with first/random tie breaking.
    3/4. Reward of selfish pool with low size and connectivity with first/random tie breaking.
